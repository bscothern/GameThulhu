import UIKit

/// The protocol that defines the UIResponder chain for Gamepads.
///
/// - Important:
///     In order for this protocol to work you must have a first reponder on the UIResponder chain.
///     To ensure that there is one you should have the following added to your UIViewController:
///
///       override var canBecomeFirstResponder: Bool {
///           return true
///       }
///
///     You **must** also make sure you call `becomeFirstResponder()` and `resignFirstResponder()` in
///     `UIViewController.viewWillAppear(_:)` and `UIViewController.viewWillDisappear(_:)` respectively.
///
///     If you do all of these things the responder chain will work and the events will happen as expected.
